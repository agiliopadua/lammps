<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Apply two Langevin thermostats as described in <A HREF = "#Jiang">(Jiang)</A> for 
thermalizing the reduced degrees of freedom of Drude oscillators.
</P>
<P>Drude oscillators are a way to simulate polarizable atoms, by splitting
them into a core and a Drude particle bound by a spring. The Drude particle
carries a charge subtracted from the core, so that the core-Drude particle
pair represents a dipole, with a total charge equal to that of the initial atom. 
The Drude particles represent the electronic clouds around the nuclei. They 
have normally no Lennard-Jones interactions.
</P>
<P>The Drude particle and the core should be connected by a 
<A HREF = "bond_harmonic.html">harmonic bond</A> of zero equilibrium distance and of 
(half-)stiffness 
\begin{equation} K = \frac 1 2\, \frac {q^2} \alpha \end{equation}
where \(q\) is the charge of the Drude particle and \(\alpha\) is the atom polarizability.
</P>
Ideally, the mass of Drude particles would vanish and their positions would be 
determined self-consistently by iterative minimization of the energy, the cores' 
positions being fixed.
It is however more efficient and it yields comparable results, if the dipoles 
are thermalized at a low temperature <A HREF = "#Lamoureux">(Lamoureux)</A>.
In that case, the Drude particles need a small mass. The thermalization works
by transforming the particles degrees of freedom by: 
<BR>
<I>In these equations upper case denotes atomic or center of mass values and lower 
case denotes Drude particle or dipole values. Primes denote the transformed 
(reduced) values, while bare letters denote the original values.</I> 
<BR>
Velocities:
\begin{equation} V' = \frac {M\, V + m\, v} {M'} \end{equation}
\begin{equation} v' = v - V \end{equation}
Masses:
\begin{equation} M' = M + m \end{equation}
\begin{equation} m' = \frac {M\, m } {M'} \end{equation}
The Langevin forces are computed as
\begin{equation} F' = - \frac {M'} {\mathtt{damp\_com}}\, V' + F_r' \end{equation}
\begin{equation} f' = - \frac {m'} {\mathtt{damp\_drude}}\, v' + f_r' \end{equation}
\(F_r'\) is a random force proportional to 
\(\sqrt { \frac {2\, k_B \mathtt{Tcom}\, M'} 
                 {\mathrm dt\, \mathtt{damp\_com} } 
        } \). 
<BR>
\(f_r'\) is a random force proportional to 
\(\sqrt { \frac {2\, k_B \mathtt{Tdrude}\, m'} 
                 {\mathrm dt\, \mathtt{damp\_drude} } 
        } \). 
<BR>
<P>Then the real forces acting on the particles are computed from the inverse 
transform:
\begin{equation} F = \frac M {M'}\, F' - f' \end{equation}
\begin{equation} f = \frac m {M'}\, F' + f' \end{equation}
</P>
<P>This fix also thermostates non-polarizable atoms in the group at temperature 
<I>Tcom</I>, as if they had a massless Drude partner.
The Drude particles themselves need not be in the group. The center of mass and 
the dipole are thermostated iff the core atom is in the group.
</P>
<P>Note that the thermostat effect of this fix is applied to only the translational
degrees of freedom of the particles, which is an important
consideration for finite-size particles, which have rotational degrees
of freedom, are being thermostated. The translational degrees of
freedom can also have a bias velocity removed from them before
thermostating takes place; see the description below.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Like the <A HREF = "fix_langevin.html">fix langevin</A> command, this fix
does NOT perform time integration. It only modifies forces to effect
thermostating. Thus you must use a separate time integration fix,
like <A HREF = "fix_nve.html">fix nve</A> or <A HREF = "fix_nh.html">fix nph</A> to actually update 
the velocities and positions of atoms using the modified forces.  Likewise, 
this fix should not normally be used on atoms that also have their temperature
controlled by another fix - e.g. by <A HREF = "fix_nh.html">fix nvt</A> or <A HREF = "fix_temp_rescale.html">fix
temp/rescale</A> commands.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_16">this howto section</A> of the manual for
a discussion of different ways to compute temperature and perform
thermostating.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The status of the atoms (core or Drude particle or non-polarizable atom) must 
be specified by a <A HREF = "fix_property_atom.html">fix property/atom</A>.
Two integer properties are required, which must be called <I>drudeid</I> and <I>drudetype</I>.
If <I>drudeid</I> is 0, the atom is a non-polarizable atom. Otherwise, the atom is either
a Drude particle or the core of a polarizable atom. Then, <I>drudeid</I> must the id
(tag) of the partner of the atom. For cores, <I>drudeid</I> must be the id of the
corresponding Drude particle. For Drude particles <I>drudeid</I> must be the id of the
corresponding core.
If <I>drudetype</I> is 0, the atom is not polarizable.
If <I>drudetype</I> is 1, the atom is the core of a polarizable atom.
If <I>drudetype</I> is 2, the atom is a Drude particle.
For consistency, if <I>drudetype</I> is not 0, <I>drudeid</I> must not be 0.
Ghost atoms need to know their <I>drudeid</I> and <I>drudetype</I> properties, so the 
<A HREF = "fix_property_atom.html">fix property/atom</A> command must be used with the keyword
<I>ghost</I> set to <I>yes</I>.
</P>
<P>The Drude particle and its core should not have electrostatic interactions.
So the <A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A> command must exclude coulombic 
interaction between 1-2 neighbors (which is done by default).
If polarizable atoms are 1-2, 1-3 or 1-4 neighbors, the same screening defined
by <A HREF = "special_bonds.html">special_bonds</A> should apply to their Drude partners.
See <A HREF = "fix_special_drude.html">fix special/drude</A> for how the lists of special 
neighbors can be redefined.
</P>
<HR>

<P><I>Tcom</I> is the target temperature of the centers of mass, which would be used to
thermostate the non-polarizable atoms.
<I>Tdrude</I> is the (normally low) target temperature of the core-Drude particle 
pairs (dipoles).
<I>Tcom</I> and <I>Tdrude</I> can be specified as an equal-style <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A>.
If the value is a variable, it should be specified as
v_name, where name is the variable name. In this case, the variable
will be evaluated each timestep, and its value used to determine the
target temperature.
</P>
<P>Equal-style variables can specify formulas with various mathematical
functions, and include <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style</A> command
keywords for the simulation box parameters and timestep and elapsed
time.  Thus it is easy to specify a time-dependent temperature.
</P>
<P>Like other fixes that perform thermostating, this fix can be used
with <A HREF = "compute.html">compute commands</A> that remove a "bias" from the
atom velocities.  E.g. removing the center-of-mass velocity from a
group of atoms.  This is not done by default, but only if the
<A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> command is used to assign a temperature
compute to this fix that includes such a bias term.  See the doc pages
for individual <A HREF = "compute.html">compute commands</A> to determine which ones
include a bias.  In this case, the thermostat works in the following
manner: bias is removed from each atom, thermostating is performed on
the remaining thermal degrees of freedom, and the bias is added back
in. -- NOT TESTED -- 
</P>
<P>Note: The target temperature of the core-Drude particle pairs should be
chosen low enough, so as to mimic as closely as possible the self-consistent
minimization. It must however be high enough, so that the dipoles can follow 
the local electric field exerted by the neighbouring atoms. The optimal value
probably depends on the temperature of the centers of mass and on the mass of 
the Drude particles.
</P>
<P>Note: The spring stiffness must be chosen high enough, so that the Drude 
particle stays close to its core and that the pair can approximate a point
dipole. However, the higher the stiffness, the quicker the oscillations. Quick
oscillations require a small timestep, which leads to longer simulation times.
For the same reason, the mass of the Drude particles cannot be chosen too small,
because the oscillations of the dipole would be too quick and would require too
a small timestep.
</P>
<P><I>damp_com</I> is the characteristic time for reaching thermal equilibrium of the 
centers of mass.
For example, a value of 100.0 means to relax the temperature of the centers of 
mass in a timespan of (roughly) 100 time units (tau or fmsec or psec - see the 
<A HREF = "units.html">units</A> command).
<I>damp_drude</I> is the characteristic time for reaching thermal equilibrium of the
dipoles. It is typically a few timesteps.
</P>
<P>The number <I>seed_com</I> and <I>seed_drude</I> are positive integers. They set the seeds
 of the Marsaglia random number generators used for generating the random forces 
 on centers of mass and on the dipoles. Each processor uses the input seed to 
 generate its own unique seed and its own stream of random numbers.
Thus the dynamics of the system will not be identical on two runs on
different numbers of processors.
</P>
<P>The keyword <I>zero</I> can be used to eliminate drift due to the thermostat on 
centers of mass. Because the random forces on different centers of mass are
independent, they do not sum exactly to zero.  As a result, this fix
applies a small random force to the entire system, and the
momentum of the total center of mass of the system undergoes a slow random walk. 
If the keyword <I>zero</I> is set to <I>yes</I>, the total random force on the centers of 
mass is set exactly to zero by subtracting off an equal part of it from each 
center of mass in the group. As a result, the total center of mass of a system 
with zero initial momentum will not drift over time.

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  Because the state of the random number generator
is not saved in restart files, this means you cannot do "exact"
restarts with this fix, where the simulation continues on the same as
if no restart had taken place.  However, in a statistical sense, a
restarted simulation should produce the same behavior.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> <I>temp</I> option is supported by this
fix.  You can use it to assign a temperature <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A>
you have defined to this fix which will be used in its thermostating
procedure, as described above. For consistency, the group used by the compute 
should include the group of this fix and the Drude particles. -- NOT TESTED -- 
</P>
<P>This fix computes a global vector of 6 components which can be accessed by 
various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output commands</A>. The meaning of the
components are
